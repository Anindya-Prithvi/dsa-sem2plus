#### Boring stuff
This repository houses my attempts to learn Java along with Data Structures and Algorithms and also follow JEP guidelines. The codes in this repository are not guaranteed to be correct and may have bad coding practices. However, with my progression in the semester, I have showcased remarkable imporvement in code quality and of course, algorithmic efficiency.

This repository may or may not get updated with my future codes.
